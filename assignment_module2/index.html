	Finalized in the middle of 2000th, AVC is still a basis of modern video technology domain. Compression is much more efficient than for previous codecs (like MPEG2). Nowadays it still covers more than 60% of all video storage and transmission.

	This successor of AVC came to market around 10 years after the ancestor. Significantly beats AVC in coding effeciency, especially at ultra hight resolutions.

	Use of AVC and HEVC costs money (charges to patent holders). Industry is looking for free alternative. AV1 is response to this reques. It's created by Allianse For Open Media which consists of technology leaders like Google, Intel and others. Finalized at late 2018, free and beats HEVC in coding efficiency. But extremely complex from computational perspective.
